            <h2>With this database, we can show various correlations that can be used in our queries. We have a good understanding of the age, employment, and education demographic that makes up each state which all have an impact on economic growth and the competitiveness of the state’s workforce. Additionally, knowing data on car accidents per state can also give insight into the safety of the state’s roads, as well as identify areas that may need improvement in terms of driver behavior. Comparing all of these datasets allows for a better understanding of the correlating values.
